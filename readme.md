# ⚛️ React Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects built while learning **React.js**. Each project is focused on practicing key concepts — from basic setup with Vite to Context API, React Router, and Redux Toolkit.

These are not deployed — they serve as **learning milestones** and a reflection of my progress in mastering React fundamentals.
